The goal of this project was to create three different card games. The most difficult game being the Highest match game(Game C), where the player goes against the dealer. I spent a lot of time trying to get the player and dealer hands to work, while also being able to replace the cards.

The goal of this was to learn how to use interfaces and enums, while also reviewing derived classes.
