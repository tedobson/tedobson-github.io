The goal of this project was to create three different card games the player could choose from. The most difficult game being the Highest match game(Game C), where the player goes against the dealer. I spent a lot of time trying to get the player and dealer hands to work, while also being able to replace the cards.

The goal of this project was to showcase everything that I had learned so far in C# and WPF. The hardest thing for me was to get the methods for searching the player's information or inventory to be printed on the screen. I feel like I could've made this way better with more time.

A ordle, where the player has 5 tries to guess a popular five letter word.
The goal of this was to get refamiliarize myself with WPF again. It was interesting learning how to navigate through the different pages, and the different properties you could use on buttons and text boxes.

The goal of this was to learn how to use interfaces and enums, while also reviewing derived classes.
